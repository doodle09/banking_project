Banking Customer and Loan Analysis (EDA Project)

This project focuses on exploring banking customer data to understand how demographics such as age and nationality relate to loan amounts. The analysis was done using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and the goal was to uncover trends that can help in customer segmentation and loan strategy planning.

The dataset includes customer age, nationality, and loan values. Using these features, several visualizations were created to study distribution patterns and relationships across different customer groups.

Key Insights

Customers from Europe and Asia form the largest share of the bank’s customer base. Average loan amounts vary by nationality, with Australian and American customers showing slightly higher average loan values.
The relationship between age and loan amount changes across age groups, suggesting that no single age range dominates borrowing activity.
The age distribution shows that the bank primarily serves adults between 20 and 60 years old.

Tech Stack Used

Python was used for the entire analysis, along with Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations. Power BI was also used to build an interactive dashboard summarizing the insights.
Techniques included data cleaning, grouping, aggregation, and exploratory data analysis.

Visual Outputs

Several charts were created to represent the findings clearly:

• A pie chart showing the share of customers by nationality
• A bar chart comparing average loan amounts across different nationalities
• A line graph showing how loan amounts vary with age
• A histogram depicting the overall age distribution of customers

These visuals together provide a clear overview of customer behavior and loan trends.

Conclusion

The analysis provides useful insights into how nationality and age relate to loan patterns. While these features give an initial understanding of customer behavior, additional information such as income, employment status, and credit history would help build a more complete picture.
Overall, the project demonstrates practical EDA skills using Python and communicates findings effectively through visualizations and dashboards.
